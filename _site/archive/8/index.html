          <p>About six months ago Mozilla altered it's Firefox release schedule to aim for one release every other month or so. So whilst the time span from Firefox 3 to Firefox 4 was around three years, that from version 4 to 7 was just six months.  With version 10 scheduled for early 2012. This seems to be a direct response to Google's Chrome upping its major version every few weeks. It is now on version 16. Obviously bigger is better - Mozilla are perhaps afraid that users will perceive their progress as slow with respect to others. On the other and that has never bothered Microsoft which took a decade to move from IE6 to IE9.</p>

It is a Scottish website for registered dentists only who are given access to the site using a code provided by their NHS Trust.  The site is essentially an application to test the dentist's ability to identify dental problems using a Standardisation Test. Users can retake the test as often as they want. Once they pass, a personalised PDF certificate is available for them to download.</p>
