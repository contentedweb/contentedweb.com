I met with various friends who had come from Hong Kong and England, myself having flown in from Germany. And it was kind of creepy, because not much had changed in the place and it felt like I had only been there two days ago.</p>

Spending easter in Brussels I decided to go to Paris for a day, a city I had never seen before. So I bought myself a one day return ticket to Paris on the TGV, boarded it at 9.30 am in Brussels and was in Paris before 11am, arriving at the Gare du Nord. From here I, unknowingly, set out on what became a seven hour trek around Paris.</p>

<p>Finally, after 15 years in web development (6 months after leaving the field), I have documentary proof of the size of a pt. Of course that won't help me in figuring out the size on an iPad, iPhone and 32" TV, but nonetheless, nice to know.</p>

The design and markup of this responsive website were created by Design By day and implemented in Wordpress by Minervation (by me :-) ). My work involved a fair bit of programming getting lots of feeds working as well as various JavaScript effects. This is our first responsive website and we are very proud of the outcome. Our extensive user testing indicates users will like this site. We hope you do too.</p>

          <p><img src="/assets/images/cebd1.png" alt="Homepage of CEBD" width="300" height="245" />In June 2012 Minervation launched the redesigned CEBD site. This included a complete makeover as well moving the content into Wordpress.  My involvement, as with many of our more straightforward Wordpress sites was minimal.  Wordpress just makes it so easy to create websites with little technical know-how.</p>
