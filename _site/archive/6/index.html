  <p>Over the last couple of years I've been reading Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels. I've almost finished Interesting Times, where he writes this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you think this is, homeopathic warfare? The smaller your side the more likely you are to win?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Love it.</p>

<p>Minervation have now launched the redesigned Patient Information Forum website. It has been moved to Wordpress and given a very nice facelift.  As I no longer work for Minervation my involvement was limited to the initial recommendations as to plugins and so on.</p>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/acta.png" alt="ACTA Community Theatre homepage" width="300" height="229" />Minervation have just launched a new, WordPress based, website for the ACTA Community Theatre in Bristol. Whilst I no longer work for Minervation and didn't finish this website, I did help in laying the ground work for it and specifically sorting out the various homepage streams.</p>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/plovdiv.jpg" alt="City of Plovdiv" width="300" height="225" />I've moved over a couple of very old posts on Bulgaria from my old site to this blog as part of my task to centralise all my web content. These posts were written during my first visit to Bulgaria: a one year failed attempt to make it my home in 2003.</p>

  <p>I love this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let your boat of life be light, packed with only what you need - a homely home and simple pleasures, one or two friends, worth the name, someone to love and someone to love you, a cat, a dog, and a pipe or two, enough to eat and enough to wear, and a little more than enough to drink; for thirst is a dangerous thing.</p>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/tti.png" alt="Testing Treatments Interactive homepage" width="300" height="246" /></p>
<p>The second edition of the Testing Treatments site is now online. It is an international edition with translations of the site into several different languages in progress. It includes intelligent cross-linking between the various languages.</p>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/wayasewa.jpg" alt="Huts on a ledge overlooking the beach and sea on a small island" width="384" height="256" />It's been almost 15 years since I embarked on a 7 month round the world trip. I wrote up my entire trip shortly after that, but the old site is now in danger of being lost as it is not maintained by me anymore. So I have moved all my writings from there into this blog, dated round about when I wrote them originally.</p>

  <p>Copy and paste, quick hacks and <a title="Big Ball of Mud" href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/">big balls of mud</a>. These are rightly frowned upon in the software industry, but they happen elsewhere too. Often the programmer gets the blame for being lazy. Programmers will invariably blame poor management. But the real culprit is usually more simple: the budget.</p>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/iccs.png" alt="" width="300" height="193" />In July 2012 Minervation launched the Informed Choice about Cancer Screening for the King’s Health Partners. This website concerns the review to develop a new approach to present information on the benefits and harms of cancer screening for the public, patients and health professionals in a balanced and even-handed way, which is conducted on behalf of the <a href="http://cancerscreening.nhs.uk/">NHS Cancer Screening Programmes</a>.</p>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/careers.png" alt="Homepage of Careers Service" width="300" height="212" />After several months in development, Minervation have now launched the new website for the Oxford University Careers Service. The design and markup of this responsive website were created by Design By day and implemented in Wordpress by Minervation (by me :-) ). My work involved a fair bit of programming getting lots of feeds working as well as various JavaScript effects. This is our first responsive website and we are very proud of the outcome. Our extensive user testing indicates users will like this site. We hope you do too.</p>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/cebd1.png" alt="Homepage of CEBD" width="300" height="245" />In June 2012 Minervation launched the redesigned CEBD site. This included a complete makeover as well moving the content into Wordpress.  My involvement, as with many of our more straightforward Wordpress sites was minimal.  Wordpress just makes it so easy to create websites with little technical know-how.</p>

  <p>This post is written using the wordpress android app. <a href="http://android.wordpress.org/">You can download it here</a>.</p>
<p>It has been written using android speech to text function. This works very well as long as you have a wifi connection. So it helps I am waiting for my daughter at the OMV petrol station which has free wifi!</p>

  <p>Good article from Nielsen about the quality of local international sites: <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/country-site.html">http://www.useit.com/alertbox/country-site.html</a></p>
<p>In my opinion the worst offenders are those who redirect you to the local website based on your IP address.</p>
