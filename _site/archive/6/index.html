  <p><img src="/assets/images/wayasewa.jpg" alt="Huts on a ledge overlooking the beach and sea on a small island" width="384" height="256" />It's been almost 15 years since I embarked on a 7 month round the world trip. I wrote up my entire trip shortly after that, but the old site is now in danger of being lost as it is not maintained by me anymore. So I have moved all my writings from there into this blog, dated round about when I wrote them originally.</p>

  <p>Copy and paste, quick hacks and <a title="Big Ball of Mud" href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/">big balls of mud</a>. These are rightly frowned upon in the software industry, but they happen elsewhere too. Often the programmer gets the blame for being lazy. Programmers will invariably blame poor management. But the real culprit is usually more simple: the budget.</p>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/iccs.png" alt="" width="300" height="193" />In July 2012 Minervation launched the Informed Choice about Cancer Screening for the King’s Health Partners. This website concerns the review to develop a new approach to present information on the benefits and harms of cancer screening for the public, patients and health professionals in a balanced and even-handed way, which is conducted on behalf of the <a href="http://cancerscreening.nhs.uk/">NHS Cancer Screening Programmes</a>.</p>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/careers.png" alt="Homepage of Careers Service" width="300" height="212" />After several months in development, Minervation have now launched the new website for the Oxford University Careers Service. The design and markup of this responsive website were created by Design By day and implemented in Wordpress by Minervation (by me :-) ). My work involved a fair bit of programming getting lots of feeds working as well as various JavaScript effects. This is our first responsive website and we are very proud of the outcome. Our extensive user testing indicates users will like this site. We hope you do too.</p>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/cebd1.png" alt="Homepage of CEBD" width="300" height="245" />In June 2012 Minervation launched the redesigned CEBD site. This included a complete makeover as well moving the content into Wordpress.  My involvement, as with many of our more straightforward Wordpress sites was minimal.  Wordpress just makes it so easy to create websites with little technical know-how.</p>

  <p>This post is written using the wordpress android app. <a href="http://android.wordpress.org/">You can download it here</a>.</p>
<p>It has been written using android speech to text function. This works very well as long as you have a wifi connection. So it helps I am waiting for my daughter at the OMV petrol station which has free wifi!</p>

  <p>Good article from Nielsen about the quality of local international sites: <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/country-site.html">http://www.useit.com/alertbox/country-site.html</a></p>
<p>In my opinion the worst offenders are those who redirect you to the local website based on your IP address.</p>

  <p>About a month ago, <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Jeffery Zeldman</a>, redesigned his website to be all about content. A little later, he wrote <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2012/05/18/web-design-manifesto-2012/">an article about it</a>, after receiving comments that he had obviously not tested his site on the desktop. I really like the new design. It's a pleasure to read, that's for sure.</p>

  <p>Hover images, that is images that change when the pointer moves over them, have always been an integral part of web development. They alert the user to the fact that the image is "active". Usually this indicates it can be clicked.</p>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/minervationcom.png" alt="" width="300" height="235" />As part of the general move to Wordpress at Minervation, we re-developed the Minervation site in Wordpress. Almost all of this work was done without me, except for the task of integrating Mienrvation's .Net based LIDA tool into the website.</p>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/gmc.png" alt="" width="300" height="259" />In 2011 Minervation, was tasked to design and create the markup for the new GMC (General Medical Council) Learning disabilities website. The actual design was done by Design by Day and implemented using Minervation's Phaedrus content managements system as a proof of concept and for usability testing. The final markup (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and content were then delivered as a package to the GMC. The designs went live in April 2012.</p>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/hla.png" alt="Healthyliving award website" width="300" height="249" />The healthyliving award rewards caterers in Scotland for dishing up healthier food and helping their customers make better food choices. Minervation redesigned this website and developed a members area to enable award holders to get online access to information specific to their award. Whilst most new Minervation sites are being developed in Wordpress, this one still uses Minervation's in-house CMS "Phaedrus".</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2012/ubuntu-useful-hints/">Ubuntu useful hints</a></h2>

  <p>In this post I will be maintaing a list of useful hints for future reference.</p>
<p><strong>Mouse speed</strong></p>
<p>I find the default mouse speed much too fast. And even after reducing both speed and acceleration to a minimum it is still too fast. Some googling through up this handy hint:</p>
<p><a href="http://patrickmylund.com/blog/lowering-gaming-mouse-sensitivity-in-ubuntu-9-10/">http://patrickmylund.com/blog/lowering-gaming-mouse-sensitivity-in-ubuntu-9-10/</a></p>
<p>So I ran these commands:<code></code></p>
<p><code>xinput --list --short<br />
xinput --set-prop "Device name or ID" "Device Accel Constant Deceleration" 2<br />
</code></p>
