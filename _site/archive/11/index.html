<h2><a href="/posts/2003/overview-of-bulgaria/">Overview of Bulgaria</a></h2>
<time datetime="2003-07-16 12:00:00"><span class="date-day">16</span> <span class="date-month">July</span>, <span class="date-year">2003</span></time>
  <p>Bulgaria is a beautiful, small country in the south-eastern corner of Europe. It has a population of some 8 million people and borders on Greece, Macedonia, Serbia, Romania and Turkey, as well as the Black Sea. Few people seem to know much about Bulgaria, which is surprising, given its rich history and interesting culture. </p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2003/web-standards/">The case for Web Standards</a></h2>
<time datetime="2003-05-15 12:00:00"><span class="date-day">15</span> <span class="date-month">May</span>, <span class="date-year">2003</span></time>
  <p>There is a lot of talk at present about the need for web standards and their use in real life situations. Many developers/designers, whilst appreciating the need for common standards, tend to ignore them if something can be more easily implemented in another way. The main reason for this, they claim, is largely that not all functionality is available to them or few browsers adequately support the standards.</p>

  <p>The history of web browsers started with the "invention" of the world-wide-web by Tim Berners-Lee at the beginning of the '90s. The first widely used browser was Mosaic. Netscape entered the browser market shortly after this giving birth to what is commonly known as the "Browser Wars".</p>

  <p>Here <del>are</del> were some photos of Camden, the area I lived in for the best part of two years. A more bizzare, interesting, diverse and touristy place all wrapped in one is not known to me anywhere on earth. It is unique.

  <h3>Madrid and Toledo</h3>
<p>The first thing that struck me on arrival in Madrid was the relaxed nature of everything, especially for a capital city (compare London!). The second thing was the amount of people on the streets at midnight - it was a Tuesday! I knew I was going to like this place.</p>

  <h3>Malaysia</h3>
<p><img alt="Batu Caves" src="/assets/images/batucave.jpg" width="400" height="532" />Reverse Culture Shock - I believe is the correct term. I arrived in KL and got picked up by my friend at the airport, who drove me to my accommodation. Now, it just so happens that my mates family own a very successful chain of hotels (Grand Continental) across Malaysia. So when I walked into my new room, I didn't walk into some drab room with insects crawling around the floor, as had been the norm for the last 6 weeks. Instead I couldn't believe my eyes when my mate showed me into one of the hotel's suites. I didn't even dare sit down. Eventually my mate convinced to take a seat, so I cautiously sat down on the edge of the bed. Wow!</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2000/sumatra/">Sumatra</a></h2>

  <p><img alt="Gunung Dempu" src="/assets/images/dempu.jpg" width="400" height="228" />The journey to Sumatra was ok, the ferry crossing giving particularly nice views of Sumatra. Travelling on the trans-summatran highway can however be quite a hair raising experience. The road is winding and difficult to see ahead, this however doesn't stop busses from overtaking round blind corners. The legacy of this was not hard to spot. We drove past at least two burnt out lorries, one of which must have been very recent, judging by the onlookers standing around. Eventually, I arrived safely in Lahat at around 3am and had to hang around until 8am for the bus on to Pagaralam in the Pasemah Highlands, my actual destination.</p>

  <h2>Mount Bromo</h2>
<p><img alt="Gunung Batok" src="/assets/images/batok.jpg" width="384" height="256" />I arrived in Probbolingo, Java around 3am,after my first long distance public bus ride in Asia, which took about 5 hours. The bus was Ok and they even showed a film. Not that I could understand much, since it was Japanese, with what I figure were English, Indonesian and Chinese subtitles all on top of each other! Getting off the bus I became yet another victim of what is the best organised scam I came across. This I have documented elsewhere.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2000/bali/">Bali</a></h2>

  <h2>Kuta</h2>
<p><img alt="Pura Besahki" src="/assets/images/temple.jpg" width="400" height="265" />I arrived on Bali and for about the only time on my trip I was lost. Not geographically, but in a 'what on earth am I going to do now' sort of way. Luckily, as always seemed to happen in these situations, I bumped into another backpacker at the tourist info stand. She seemed to have more of an idea than I did and we ended up sharing a room together in Kuta. She had also thought ahead and had not forgotten the most vital of items...toilet paper. Kuta itself is OK, but full of extremely persistent street hawkers (I got ripped off on a watch which started going backwards after a day). So we headed off to the cultural center of Bali, Ubud.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2000/australia-red-centre/">Australia Red Centre</a></h2>

  <h2>Darwin</h2>
<p><img alt="Aboriginal Painting" src="/assets/images/abopainting1.jpg" width="384" height="256" />Probably the main reason for heading to Darwin is for the national parks. These include Litchfield, Nitmiluk and Kakadu. I decided on a three day tour of Kakadu National Park, by far the largest of the lot. First stop was a river tour to see wild alligators. Next we drove on to Nourlangie Rock to look at some aboriginal paintings. The one on this page is of an aboriginal "Bogey Man". It was meant to scare children away from areas they were not supposed to visit. We then headed on and walked up a hill to a lookout called Nawurlandja. This gave outstanding views of the park. And much like the Blue Mountains a few weeks earlier, the vastness of the place was quite remarkable.</p>

  <h2>Sydney</h2>
<p><img alt="Opera House" src="/assets/images/operahouse.jpg" width="400" height="232" />Sydney has a lot to offer. Whilst the city is not necessarily beautiful, it does have some fantastic views. Of course the Opera House is beautiful, as is Harbour Bridge and the whole of the Bay Area (best seen from Sydney Tower). There are plenty of beaches everywhere. Famous Bondi beach is nice and Manly Beach across the bay makes for a nice day out. If you want to cruise through the bay, save some money by not going on a tour and get the ferry to Manly. Then catch the last ferry back, just in time for a beautiful sunset view of the Sydney skyline.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2000/new-zealand/">New Zealand</a></h2>

  <h2>Auckland</h2>
<p><img alt="Kiwi Experience" src="/assets/images/kiwiexp.jpg" width="400" height="233" />I had to hang around till 5.30 am at Nadi Airport for my flight out. Fiji might be the most gorgeous place on earth, but its airport sucks. I would strongly advise against trying to stay the night here, the chairs are awful and designed in such a way that it is impossible lie down across a row of them. The flight was Ok and I arrived in Auckland, New Zealand a few hours later. I checked into the Auckland Central Backpackers (ACB). This must be the biggest hostel in the world. The thing had about 10 floors, including a roof top cafe. I didn't get up to much in Auckland. It seemed like a nice place, but I was still in Fiji mode and couldn't get used to the 'busy' way of life. So I decided for the easy option for touring New Zealand and bought myself a Kiwi Experience ticket. Whilst it seemed a tad expensive, I had a great laugh for the month I used the ticket and would recommend this to anyone else wanting to see New Zealand in a relatively short space of time.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2000/fiji/">Fiji</a></h2>

  <p><img alt="Waya Sewa" src="/assets/images/wayasewa.jpg" width="384" height="256" />Flying to Fiji was a peculiar experience. I boarded the plane just 1am on Tuesday morning and arrived in Nadi, Fiji on Wednesday about 9am. A flight of more than 24 hours. What had happened? I crossed the international dateline and thereby lost a day of my life. In much the same way as Phileas Fogg and his sturdy companion Passepartout gained a day in Jules Vernes' "Around the World in 80 days", enabling them to win the bet. Except, of course, that I had more than 80 days in which to complete my trip and was much aided by the invention of the jet engine.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2000/hawaii/">Hawaii</a></h2>

  <h2>O'ahu</h2>
<p><img alt="Diamond Head" src="/assets/images/diamondhead.jpg" width="384" height="256">Flying in to Hawaii can be really beautiful, seeing those little green islands all alone in the pacific. You're not disappointed when you land either. Honolulu is Ok. It's got quite a good nightlife and plenty of beaches within walking distance. This makes it an ideal holiday destination and hence the place can be packed with tourists. On O'ahu itself there isn't quiet as much natural beauty as on the other islands. Diamond Head is an interesting crater of an exploded volcano, the North Shore is pretty and is the hang out area for the hundreds of surfers who swarm over Oahu in the main season. Judging by the waves I saw, I can understand why.</p>

  <h3>Los Angeles</h3>
<p><img alt="Santa Monica Beach" src="/assets/images/smbeach.jpg" width="384" height="256">Los Angeles, California was the first port of call on my trip. It is an enjoyable place to stay, especially if you're interested in the entertainment business or just want to relax on the beach. I stayed in Santa Monica and Venice Beach for about a week. Santa Monica is a bit more upmarket and has the famous pier with a Ferris wheel. Venice on the other hand is plain crazy. Especially on Sundays when there beach walk is full of entertainers. You can spend all day just watching performers and entertainers go about their business.</p>
