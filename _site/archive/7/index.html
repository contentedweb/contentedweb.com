<time datetime="2012-05-25 12:00:00"><span class="date-day">25</span> <span class="date-month">May</span>, <span class="date-year">2012</span></time>
  <p>Hover images, that is images that change when the pointer moves over them, have always been an integral part of web development. They alert the user to the fact that the image is "active". Usually this indicates it can be clicked.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2012/minervation-com-wordpress-migration/">Minervation.com Wordpress migration</a></h2>
<time datetime="2012-04-23 12:00:00"><span class="date-day">23</span> <span class="date-month">April</span>, <span class="date-year">2012</span></time>
  <p><img src="/assets/images/minervationcom.png" alt="" width="300" height="235" />As part of the general move to Wordpress at Minervation, we re-developed the Minervation site in Wordpress. Almost all of this work was done without me, except for the task of integrating Mienrvation's .Net based LIDA tool into the website.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2012/gmc-learning-disabilities-website/">GMC Learning disabilities website</a></h2>
<time datetime="2012-04-02 12:00:00"><span class="date-day">2</span> <span class="date-month">April</span>, <span class="date-year">2012</span></time>
  <p><img src="/assets/images/gmc.png" alt="" width="300" height="259" />In 2011 Minervation, was tasked to design and create the markup for the new GMC (General Medical Council) Learning disabilities website. The actual design was done by Design by Day and implemented using Minervation's Phaedrus content managements system as a proof of concept and for usability testing. The final markup (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and content were then delivered as a package to the GMC. The designs went live in April 2012.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2012/healthyliving-award/">Healthyliving award</a></h2>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/hla.png" alt="Healthyliving award website" width="300" height="249" />The healthyliving award rewards caterers in Scotland for dishing up healthier food and helping their customers make better food choices. Minervation redesigned this website and developed a members area to enable award holders to get online access to information specific to their award. Whilst most new Minervation sites are being developed in Wordpress, this one still uses Minervation's in-house CMS "Phaedrus".</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2012/ubuntu-useful-hints/">Ubuntu useful hints</a></h2>
<time datetime="2012-03-09 12:00:00"><span class="date-day">9</span> <span class="date-month">March</span>, <span class="date-year">2012</span></time>
  <p>In this post I will be maintaing a list of useful hints for future reference.</p>
<p><strong>Mouse speed</strong></p>
<p>I find the default mouse speed much too fast. And even after reducing both speed and acceleration to a minimum it is still too fast. Some googling through up this handy hint:</p>
<p><a href="http://patrickmylund.com/blog/lowering-gaming-mouse-sensitivity-in-ubuntu-9-10/">http://patrickmylund.com/blog/lowering-gaming-mouse-sensitivity-in-ubuntu-9-10/</a></p>
<p>So I ran these commands:<code></code></p>
<p><code>xinput --list --short<br />
xinput --set-prop "Device name or ID" "Device Accel Constant Deceleration" 2<br />
</code></p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2012/ubuntu-on-windows-7/">Using Google to install Ubuntu on a separate hard disk without touching Windows 7</a></h2>
<time datetime="2012-02-29 12:00:00"><span class="date-day">29</span> <span class="date-month">February</span>, <span class="date-year">2012</span></time>
  <p>As we develop more and more Wordpress sites at Minervation, Linux is becoming an operating system I can no longer ignore. Sure Wordpress runs just fine on Windows however most of the information written about Wordpress pertains to Linux and Apache. It also makes little sense to pay licence fees in order to use Open Source Software. So I decided to install Ubuntu Linux on my PC over the weekend.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2012/nsuhr/">NSUHR</a></h2>
<time datetime="2012-02-23 12:00:00"><span class="date-day">23</span> <span class="date-month">February</span>, <span class="date-year">2012</span></time>
  <p><img src="/assets/images/nsuhr.png" alt="" width="300" height="240" />This was a straigtforward Wordpress website for NSUHR: An international Network to Support Understanding of Health Research. As with many of our recent, smaller, Wordpress my input was limited to technical assistance during setup and launch.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2012/site-speed/">Site Speed</a></h2>
<time datetime="2012-02-13 12:00:00"><span class="date-day">13</span> <span class="date-month">February</span>, <span class="date-year">2012</span></time>
  <p>A couple of years ago Google introduced <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html">Site Speed</a> to it's search algorithm.  This is a measure of how long it takes a page to load. You can track this measure for your site in Google Analytics as well in Google Webmaster tools.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2011/maggies-cancerlinks/">Maggie&#39;s CancerLinks</a></h2>
<time datetime="2011-12-20 12:00:00"><span class="date-day">20</span> <span class="date-month">December</span>, <span class="date-year">2011</span></time>
  <p><img src="/assets/images/maggies-e1330515893817.png?w=300" alt="Homepage of Maggie's CancerLinks" width="300" height="196" /> Maggie's has taken over the management of this valueable resource. The site has come a long from it's initial launch as the Oxford Cancer Information website. It continues to provide high quality and up-to-date links on Cancer information both locally and nationally.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2011/future-friendly-manifesto/">Future Friendly Manifesto</a></h2>
<time datetime="2011-12-13 12:00:00"><span class="date-day">13</span> <span class="date-month">December</span>, <span class="date-year">2011</span></time>
  <p>A little while back a number of well known web developers, designers and authors launched the <a title="Link to the Future Friendly website" href="http://futurefriend.ly/">futurefriend.ly</a> website. The gist of the site is to propose an approach to developing web sites and web application in a future friendly way. That is in a way which enables the content of the application to still be accessible years into the future.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2011/ideal-collaboration/">IDEAL Collaboration</a></h2>
<time datetime="2011-12-04 12:00:00"><span class="date-day">4</span> <span class="date-month">December</span>, <span class="date-year">2011</span></time>
  <p><img alt="The IDEAL Collaboration" src="/assets/images/ideal.png" width="300" height="248" />A straightforward Wordpress website aiming to "improve research quality in surgery, radiotherapy, physiotherapy and other areas of complex intervention".  To be honest I didn't have much involvement in this one, other than configuring the webserver to host the site.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2011/testing-treatments/">Testing Treatments</a></h2>
<time datetime="2011-11-20 12:00:00"><span class="date-day">20</span> <span class="date-month">November</span>, <span class="date-year">2011</span></time>
  <p><img src="/assets/images/testing-treatments.png" alt="" width="300" height="210" />This is a set of interlinked multilingual Wordpress powered websites created to promote the 2nd edition of the book "Testing Treatments", which is possibly the clearest book about Evidence Based Medicine available (or so I am told, as I am not an EBM expert). However, the fact that the first edition was translated into several languages is certainly noteworthy.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2011/jogging-away-from-your-inner-demons/">Jogging away from over your inner demons</a></h2>

  <p>Everyone knows that exercise is good for you. Not just on a physical level, but it also makes you "happier" due to the release of Endorphins, the body’s natural feel good chemicals.&nbsp; Well, since I completed the <a title="Completed Couch To 5K" href="/posts/2011/completed-couch-to-5k/">C25K</a> program I've started noticing there's much more to it than simply being happier. Jogging seems to have some sort of meditative effect, a fact I alluded to in my post on the <a title="Anatomy of one of my&nbsp;jogs" href="/posts/2011/anatomy-of-one-of-my-jogs/">anatomy of one of my jogs</a>. I noted that once I really get going I am able to spend a few seconds at a time in a trance like state with a completely clear mind. On top of that, towards the end of the jog all the aches and pains actually dissapear. Well here's my theory as to why that is.</p>

  <p>Now that <a title="Completed Couch To 5K" href="/posts/2011/completed-couch-to-5k/">I've completed the C25K running program</a>, I am looking to run further as well as increase my pace a little. "Bridge to 10 k" (B210k for short) appears to be the acronym to use, but the various <a title="Bridge to 10k program example" href="http://blog.c25kapp.com/about-bridge-to-10k/">implementations I've come across</a> are too complicated for my little mind. <a title="Completed Couch To 5K" href="/posts/2011/completed-couch-to-5k/">I don't currently have an iPod</a> or smartphone so I really don't want to be starting and stopping anymore. I just want to run for X minutes or kilometers and be done with it. This may not be the ideal methodology to follow, but it will do for me.</p>

  <p>Since I've started jogging and manage longer distances and time I've noticed a common pattern that I thought I would write down here and see it changes with time. It roughly goes like this:</p>

  <p>9 weeks ago I started on the Couch To 5K (C25K) running program. Today I completed it.</p>

  <p>About six months ago Mozilla altered it's Firefox release schedule to aim for one release every other month or so. So whilst the time span from Firefox 3 to Firefox 4 was around three years, that from version 4 to 7 was just six months.  With version 10 scheduled for early 2012. This seems to be a direct response to Google's Chrome upping its major version every few weeks. It is now on version 16. Obviously bigger is better - Mozilla are perhaps afraid that users will perceive their progress as slow with respect to others. On the other and that has never bothered Microsoft which took a decade to move from IE6 to IE9.</p>
