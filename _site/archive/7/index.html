          <p><img src="/assets/images/careers.png" alt="Homepage of Careers Service" width="300" height="212" />After several months in development, Minervation have now launched the new website for the Oxford University Careers Service. The design and markup of this responsive website were created by Design By day and implemented in Wordpress by Minervation (by me :-) ). My work involved a fair bit of programming getting lots of feeds working as well as various JavaScript effects. This is our first responsive website and we are very proud of the outcome. Our extensive user testing indicates users will like this site. We hope you do too.</p>

This included a complete makeover as well moving the content into Wordpress.  My involvement, as with many of our more straightforward Wordpress sites was minimal.  Wordpress just makes it so easy to create websites with little technical know-how.</p>

The actual design was done by Design by Day and implemented using Minervation's Phaedrus content managements system as a proof of concept and for usability testing. The final markup (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and content were then delivered as a package to the GMC. The designs went live in April 2012.</p>

<p><strong>Mouse speed</strong></p>
<p>I find the default mouse speed much too fast. And even after reducing both speed and acceleration to a minimum it is still too fast. Some googling through up this handy hint:</p>
<p><a href="http://patrickmylund.com/blog/lowering-gaming-mouse-sensitivity-in-ubuntu-9-10/">http://patrickmylund.com/blog/lowering-gaming-mouse-sensitivity-in-ubuntu-9-10/</a></p>
<p>So I ran these commands:<code></code></p>
<p><code>xinput --list --short<br />
xinput --set-prop "Device name or ID" "Device Accel Constant Deceleration" 2<br />
</code></p>

          <p>As we develop more and more Wordpress sites at Minervation, Linux is becoming an operating system I can no longer ignore. Sure Wordpress runs just fine on Windows however most of the information written about Wordpress pertains to Linux and Apache. It also makes little sense to pay licence fees in order to use Open Source Software. So I decided to install Ubuntu Linux on my PC over the weekend.</p>

          <p>Everyone knows that exercise is good for you. Not just on a physical level, but it also makes you "happier" due to the release of Endorphins, the body’s natural feel good chemicals.&nbsp; Well, since I completed the <a title="Completed Couch To 5K" href="/posts/2011/completed-couch-to-5k/">C25K</a> program I've started noticing there's much more to it than simply being happier. Jogging seems to have some sort of meditative effect, a fact I alluded to in my post on the <a title="Anatomy of one of my&nbsp;jogs" href="/posts/2011/anatomy-of-one-of-my-jogs/">anatomy of one of my jogs</a>. I noted that once I really get going I am able to spend a few seconds at a time in a trance like state with a completely clear mind. On top of that, towards the end of the jog all the aches and pains actually dissapear. Well here's my theory as to why that is.</p>
