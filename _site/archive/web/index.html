<h3><a href="/posts/2021/gitpod/">Online coding environment with Gitpod</a></h3>
<time datetime="2021-07-11 02:00:00"><span class="date-day">11</span> <span class="date-month">July</span>, <span class="date-year">2021</span></time>
  <p>Over the last few months I've made my hosting environment entirely serverless thanks to the help of <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://forestry.io/">Forrestry </a>and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. Next, I wanted a cloud based development environment, so if I wasn't at my laptop and wanted to make a change, I could.</p>
<p>There were quite a few options, but the two that seemed to fit the bill for me were <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/">GitPod </a>and <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a>. The latter is not yet available to the general public. Whilst I did register for access, it's not yet been granted. That left me with GitPod. So I signed up, pointed it at my preview branch on GitHub, added a few config settings and I was done. I had a fully fledged development environment in the cloud, including full preview functionality. The IDE is basically Visual Studio Code in the browser. It is true that coding in a browser is not quite as user friendly as in a dedicated desktop app, but it's still very much manageable for me. I don't code that much, most of it is tinkering with existing code.</p>
<p>So now I have both my hosting and development environment fully in the cloud. The cost of all this? Surely all these services must cost something. Well, for my basic needs the monthly cost is zero. Nothing, zilch, nada!</p>

<p>Having moved my site from <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress </a>to <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy </a>hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, I was looking for a better editing experience than the one provided by writing my posts in a text editor or even in <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> itself.  I've settled on <a href="https://forestry.io/">Forestry</a> for now.</p>

<h3><a href="/posts/2021/netlify-wordpress/">The Jamstack, will it supplant Wordpress?</a></h3>

<p>The web being the web, there are always opinions on which tool is better, which language superior or which hosting model future proof. The main argument for hosting appears to be traditional CMS (eg Wordpress) vs static sites and headless CMS (eg Netlify). <a href="https://thenewstack.io/jamstack-vs-wordpress-which-is-the-future-of-web-architecture/">A gentleman's barter was made between Matt Mullenweg and Ohad Eder-Pressman</a>, with Eder-Pressman asserting that the JAMStack will be the dominant architecture by Sept 2025, overtaking Wordpress who currently host over 35% of the top 10K sites.</p>

<h3><a href="/posts/2021/netlify/">Moving to Netlify</a></h3>
<time datetime="2021-04-17 02:00:00"><span class="date-day">17</span> <span class="date-month">April</span>, <span class="date-year">2021</span></time>
<p>I've now moved my site over to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. Having hosted it, at least in part, on <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">Nearlyfreespeech</a> for the best part of 15 years, I have decided to go fully serverless. This is not a slight on Nearlyfreespeech, I have had only <a href="/posts/2021/nearlyfreespeech/">positive experiences on Nearlyfreespeech</a> and they will continue to host some legacy files of mine. The main reason for this switch is because <a href="/posts/2021/eleventy-webmentions/">I started using Eleventy</a>, a static site generator, to build my site. This is great, it lead to much faster load times. But it meant I had to be on my personal laptop to update the content. I couldn't use an online service to update the site, like I could previously with <a href="https://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>. At least not without a lot of extra effort and technical skills I don't really have.   Sure I could create my content in <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, but to build and publish the site I needed to run the scripts that were on my laptop.</p>

Jeremy Keith recently blogged about the <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/17943">great usability of the UKs Covid vaccination online booking process</a>.  Having recently renewed my UK passport online I can only second this. The UKs test and trace system perhaps wasn't world beating. But their Government Digital Service most defintely is!</p>

Thanks to a <a href="https://adactio.com/links/17811">post by Jeremy Keith</a>, I came across this post by Remy Sharp on the changing web and <a href="https://remysharp.com/2021/02/11/the-web-didnt-change-you-did">framework fatigue</a>.</p>

  <p>
This site is <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">hosted on NearlyFreeSpeech.net</a>. I've been using them since 2006 and I couldn't recommend their service highly enough.  They are essentially a pay as you go service, where you pay for what you use. This makes them incredibly cheap for low use sites like mine. This site costs me less than $1 a month in hosting charges.

Finally a company that has got rid of all non-essential cookies and therefore does not need to annoy it's users with annoying privacy popups, often purposefully designed to confuse you into choosing the least private option. <a href="https://github.blog/2020-12-17-no-cookie-for-you/">Well done to GitHub for removing all non-essential cookies</a> and getting rid of privacy popups.

It's finally done. I migrated my site from <a href="https://robinmassart.wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> to a static site generated by <a href="https://11ty.dev">eleventy</a>. I've also managed to get <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">webmentions</a> working of a sort. Many thanks for all the great help available on the internet.
<p>I list here some sites I found especially helpful, but of course there are many others who gave me a nudge in the right direction.</p></p>
