  <p>In my <a title="Link rot" href="/posts/2014/link-rot/">previous post</a> about link rot I lamented the fact that a post I made on a forum was no longer helpful as I only provided the link to the solution, but not the solution itself. That link no longer works. I went back and added a new forum post with the content to help a later user with the same problem.</p>

  <p>A few years ago I wrote a post about using Windows Speech Recoginition. One of the issues I had was that it did not play well with Firefox. After lots of googling I found the solution and posted the link to it in my post:</p>

<p>Finally, after 15 years in web development (6 months after leaving the field), I have documentary proof of the size of a pt. Of course that won't help me in figuring out the size on an iPad, iPhone and 32" TV, but nonetheless, nice to know.</p>

<p>In my opinion the worst offenders are those who redirect you to the local website based on your IP address.</p>

  <p>About a month ago, <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Jeffery Zeldman</a>, redesigned his website to be all about content. A little later, he wrote <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2012/05/18/web-design-manifesto-2012/">an article about it</a>, after receiving comments that he had obviously not tested his site on the desktop. I really like the new design. It's a pleasure to read, that's for sure.</p>

  <p>Hover images, that is images that change when the pointer moves over them, have always been an integral part of web development. They alert the user to the fact that the image is "active". Usually this indicates it can be clicked.</p>

  <p>In this post I will be maintaing a list of useful hints for future reference.</p>
<p><strong>Mouse speed</strong></p>
<p>I find the default mouse speed much too fast. And even after reducing both speed and acceleration to a minimum it is still too fast. Some googling through up this handy hint:</p>
<p><a href="http://patrickmylund.com/blog/lowering-gaming-mouse-sensitivity-in-ubuntu-9-10/">http://patrickmylund.com/blog/lowering-gaming-mouse-sensitivity-in-ubuntu-9-10/</a></p>
<p>So I ran these commands:<code></code></p>
<p><code>xinput --list --short<br />
xinput --set-prop "Device name or ID" "Device Accel Constant Deceleration" 2<br />
</code></p>

  <p>As we develop more and more Wordpress sites at Minervation, Linux is becoming an operating system I can no longer ignore. Sure Wordpress runs just fine on Windows however most of the information written about Wordpress pertains to Linux and Apache. It also makes little sense to pay licence fees in order to use Open Source Software. So I decided to install Ubuntu Linux on my PC over the weekend.</p>

  <p>A couple of years ago Google introduced <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html">Site Speed</a> to it's search algorithm.  This is a measure of how long it takes a page to load. You can track this measure for your site in Google Analytics as well in Google Webmaster tools.</p>

  <p>A little while back a number of well known web developers, designers and authors launched the <a title="Link to the Future Friendly website" href="http://futurefriend.ly/">futurefriend.ly</a> website. The gist of the site is to propose an approach to developing web sites and web application in a future friendly way. That is in a way which enables the content of the application to still be accessible years into the future.</p>

  <p>About six months ago Mozilla altered it's Firefox release schedule to aim for one release every other month or so. So whilst the time span from Firefox 3 to Firefox 4 was around three years, that from version 4 to 7 was just six months.  With version 10 scheduled for early 2012. This seems to be a direct response to Google's Chrome upping its major version every few weeks. It is now on version 16. Obviously bigger is better - Mozilla are perhaps afraid that users will perceive their progress as slow with respect to others. On the other and that has never bothered Microsoft which took a decade to move from IE6 to IE9.</p>

  <p>From time to time I get asked by friends: "How do I get into web design?". There's often a sub question to that as to "what package should I use?". This is often the case if the person comes from a graphics design background. If you ask anyone who's anyone in web design what package do they use, the answer will often boil down to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Notepad* and a range of browsers"</p>

  <p>In late 1995 Bill Gates sent round the now infamous "<a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/features/auletta/about_book.html">Pearl harbour day memo</a>". In it he basically started the browser wars after it dawned on him that the internet had to power to displace the desktop as the primary gateway to all things digital. All those Office and Windows licences would become uneccessary and Microsoft's cash cow would, metaphorially speaking, be slaughtered. What happened next is now history. In 2001 IE6 was born and browser development took a five year breather.</p>

  <p>I recently came across this article about <a href="http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/11/18/evidence-for-informed-trading-on-the-attacks-of-september-11/">Evidence for Informed Trading on the Attacks of September 11</a>. I am not a conspiracy theorist, but I am going to assume that the article is valid. Certainly, the idea that no one other than the perpertrators will have known about the attack is quite far-fetched in my mind. And it doesn't take a huge leap of the imagination to think that someone might try to gain financialy from such an attrocity if they knew it was going to happen. In any case this post is not about that, it's about the ability to use the financial markets to forsee the immediate future.</p>
