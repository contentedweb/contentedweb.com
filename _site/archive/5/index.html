  <p>In my <a title="Link rot" href="/posts/2014/link-rot/">previous post</a> about link rot I lamented the fact that a post I made on a forum was no longer helpful as I only provided the link to the solution, but not the solution itself. That link no longer works. I went back and added a new forum post with the content to help a later user with the same problem.</p>

  <p>A few years ago I wrote a post about using Windows Speech Recoginition. One of the issues I had was that it did not play well with Firefox. After lots of googling I found the solution and posted the link to it in my post:</p>

  <p><a href="http://patents.stackexchange.com/"><img src="/assets/images/askpatents.png" alt="Ask Patents on Stackexchange" width="300" height="92" /></a>I came across <a title="Article describing the Ask Patents site" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2013/07/22.html">this post by Joel Spolsky</a> about a new Stackexchange site called <a href="http://patents.stackexchange.com/">Ask Patents</a> for finding prior art of patent applications. This is an excellent idea. If we all analysed one patent a day, most patents applications would be thrown out. Why? Because there is almost always prior art, it's just the patent examiners aren't able to find it due to the way the applications are written.</p>

The first thing that struck me on arrival in Madrid was the relaxed nature of everything, especially for a capital city (compare London!). The second thing was the amount of people on the streets at midnight - it was a Tuesday! I knew I was going to like this place.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2013/parague-1997/">Prague 1997</a></h2>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/prague.jpg" alt="Prague" width="300" height="207" /> I travelled to Prague by train from Munich (I was studying here at the time) to join my brother and friends on an easter holiday. We stayed in some student halls of residence, which were empty during the holidays and crammed about six of us into a room for four. Prague is certainly a very beautiful city and also very lively. At the time I went it was also extremely cheap (although had become quite expensive since my brothers first visit - this being his fourth). I would guess that nowadays central Prague, once attracting tourists seeking a cheap holiday, has turned into a typical european tourist city - with prices to match, although still reasonable. But venture slightly out of Prague and the prices quickly drop.</p>

Arriving in Rome, I met up with my friends in our hotel on via Nazionale, just round the corner from the train station on saturday afternoon. I mention this only because they had been "charged" 40000L (=£15) for the 300m cab ride! They had then paid 13000L each for a coke and ice cream in the cafe opposite!!! An ominous sign of things to come.</p>

Spending easter in Brussels I decided to go to Paris for a day, a city I had never seen before. So I bought myself a one day return ticket to Paris on the TGV, boarded it at 9.30 am in Brussels and was in Paris before 11am, arriving at the Gare du Nord. From here I, unknowingly, set out on what became a seven hour trek around Paris.</p>

<p>Finally, after 15 years in web development (6 months after leaving the field), I have documentary proof of the size of a pt. Of course that won't help me in figuring out the size on an iPad, iPhone and 32" TV, but nonetheless, nice to know.</p>
