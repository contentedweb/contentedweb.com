          <p>I have to watch the carbohydrates I eat, since I am Type 2 pre-diabetic, I made myself this list of foods I tend to eat by carbs per 100g. I've split them into 3 categories, based on the carbs per100g:</p>
<ul>
<li>high carbs, anything above 35g</li>
<li>medium carbs, between 15g and 35g</li>
<li>low carbs, between 1g and 15g</li>
<li>Negligible or no carbs, below 1g</li>
</ul>
<p>My source is basically Google searches.  This is a work in progress and will change as I add to this list.</p>

          <p>Over the last few months I've made my hosting environment entirely serverless thanks to the help of <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://forestry.io/">Forrestry </a>and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. Next, I wanted a cloud based development environment, so if I wasn't at my laptop and wanted to make a change, I could.</p>
<p>There were quite a few options, but the two that seemed to fit the bill for me were <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/">GitPod </a>and <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a>. The latter is not yet available to the general public. Whilst I did register for access, it's not yet been granted. That left me with GitPod. So I signed up, pointed it at my preview branch on GitHub, added a few config settings and I was done. I had a fully fledged development environment in the cloud, including full preview functionality. The IDE is basically Visual Studio Code in the browser. It is true that coding in a browser is not quite as user friendly as in a dedicated desktop app, but it's still very much manageable for me. I don't code that much, most of it is tinkering with existing code.</p>
<p>So now I have both my hosting and development environment fully in the cloud. The cost of all this? Surely all these services must cost something. Well, for my basic needs the monthly cost is zero. Nothing, zilch, nada!</p>

          <p>As the richer western countries approach their ceiling of who they can vaccinate freely, they are starting to vaccinate those under 18 in a drive to increase the overall vaccination rate.  This is understandable, but I wonder if a better use for those vaccines would be to ship them to poorer countries to help them in their vaccination efforts.</p>
<p>The effect of Covid on the young is very small. It is true we do not know the long term implications of having had covid. Long-covid is a real thing, which also affects the young. But the long term effects of the vaccine are also unknown.  It is looking increasingly likely that we will need yearly booster shots. Do we really want to be vaccinating 12 year olds and jabbing them every year for the rest of their lives? This is new territory, it has never been done before.</p>
<p>Let's get the world's adult population vaccinated first. As we get to understand the virus better maybe we will find a single shot solution.</p>

          <p>Yesterday I had my second Pfizer jab against Covid. When I had my first jab I felt nothing, no side effects. A slight itch on the shoulder maybe. Nothing worse than a mosquito bite.  The second one is a different matter. I woke up this morning sore, stiff and tired. No fever or other flu like symptoms, but definitely worse than the first jab. Hopefully by the weekend I will be better.</p>

          <p>After almost a year away due to the ongoing pandemic, we finally returned to Plovdiv for a week in May. The city was as lovely as usual, especially in the central old town area. Here are some photos of the city from the trip.</p>
<h2>Kapana</h2>
<p>The word Kapana means &quot;trap&quot; in Bulgarian. This is a beautifully restored quarter of small winding streets in which it is easy to get lost - or trapped.  Only a few years ago this area was dirty and run down. It has now been restored and largely pedestrianised, full of little shops, cafes, restaurants and pubs.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/149552596">It's wrong to frame radical pro climate changes as sacrifices which we have to bear with gritted teeth. Its good for your health to eat less meat, cycle or walk instead of hopping in the car. Its good for peoples health too because of reduced pollution.. Its satisfying to mend thongs instead of throwing them away. Its a pleasure to use beautiful things for a long time crafted by people who enjoyed making them, instead of throwing things away in an endless cycle of obsolescence of the ugly.</blockquote>
<p>Most actions related to stopping cimate change would also be good for our general health, mental as well as physical.</p>

          <p>Whilst reading an article about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2021/apr/29/end-of-the-ice-new-zealands-vanishing-glaciers">glaciers receeding in New Zealand</a>, I thought this photo looked strangely familiar. <img src="/assets/images/fjg-guardian.jpg" alt="Comparing the snout of the Franz Josef glacier in 1871, when the snout is at the bottom of the valley and in 2016 when the snout has receeded far up the slope" /></p>
<p>The reason it was <em>strangely</em> familiar being that I didn't remember the snout of the glacier to be so far up the hillside as in the photo of 2016. So I dug around in my albums on Flickr and indeed, the snout had receeded a worrying amount in just under 20 years.  So I did some amateur environmental change analysis and added some date lines to my photo: <img src="/assets/images/fjg-dates.jpg" alt="The Franz Josef glacier marked by date lines for 1871, 1998 and 2016 to show far up the hill the glacier has receeded in 1871" /></p>
<p>This may or may not be due to human made climate change, but this does show the changing climate on a personal level to me. Nature is not always as you might remember it, but changing all the time, for better or worse.</p>

The main argument for hosting appears to be traditional CMS (eg Wordpress) vs static sites and headless CMS (eg Netlify). <a href="https://thenewstack.io/jamstack-vs-wordpress-which-is-the-future-of-web-architecture/">A gentleman's barter was made between Matt Mullenweg and Ohad Eder-Pressman</a>, with Eder-Pressman asserting that the JAMStack will be the dominant architecture by Sept 2025, overtaking Wordpress who currently host over 35% of the top 10K sites.</p>

Having hosted it, at least in part, on <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">Nearlyfreespeech</a> for the best part of 15 years, I have decided to go fully serverless. This is not a slight on Nearlyfreespeech, I have had only <a href="/posts/2021/nearlyfreespeech/">positive experiences on Nearlyfreespeech</a> and they will continue to host some legacy files of mine. The main reason for this switch is because <a href="/posts/2021/eleventy-webmentions/">I started using Eleventy</a>, a static site generator, to build my site. This is great, it lead to much faster load times. But it meant I had to be on my personal laptop to update the content. I couldn't use an online service to update the site, like I could previously with <a href="https://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>. At least not without a lot of extra effort and technical skills I don't really have.   Sure I could create my content in <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, but to build and publish the site I needed to run the scripts that were on my laptop.</p>

          <p>
With last month's arguments between the EU and UK, regarding vaccine contracts and deliveries I did some back of an envelope analysis. It seems the real issue is not so much contracts, but the general lack of vacciness, partially due to the inability of one specific manufacturer to deliver their promised amounts of vaccines. Here are the stats as of the 10th April 2021:
<table>
  <caption>Vaccination progress for the EU and UK</caption>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <th>EU</th>
    <th>UK</th>
    <th>Combined</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Doses given (millions)</th>
    <td>93</td>
    <td>39</td>
    <td>132</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Population (millions)</th>
    <td>445</td>
    <td>68</td>
    <td>513</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Ratio doses to population</th>
    <td>0.21</td>
    <td>0.57</td>
    <td>0.26</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>All data from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">Our World in Data</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
As can be seen from the table if all the vaccine doses administered by the 10th April had been spread evenly across the EU and the UK, the effect on the vaccination rate of the EU would have been minimal: an increase of 5 doses per 100 inhabitants.  But in the UK the effect would have been drastic: a decrease of 31 doses per 100 in habitants. So whilst complaints about vaccine export controls and contracts mimicking such export controls might be valid, the real issue is the limited capacity to produce the vaccines. This is where the focus needs to be - not on blaming each other for hoarding vaccines.

Jeremy Keith recently blogged about the <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/17943">great usability of the UKs Covid vaccination online booking process</a>.  Having recently renewed my UK passport online I can only second this. The UKs test and trace system perhaps wasn't world beating. But their Government Digital Service most defintely is!</p>

Thanks to a <a href="https://adactio.com/links/17811">post by Jeremy Keith</a>, I came across this post by Remy Sharp on the changing web and <a href="https://remysharp.com/2021/02/11/the-web-didnt-change-you-did">framework fatigue</a>.</p>

This site is <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">hosted on NearlyFreeSpeech.net</a>. I've been using them since 2006 and I couldn't recommend their service highly enough.  They are essentially a pay as you go service, where you pay for what you use. This makes them incredibly cheap for low use sites like mine. This site costs me less than $1 a month in hosting charges.

Finally a company that has got rid of all non-essential cookies and therefore does not need to annoy it's users with annoying privacy popups, often purposefully designed to confuse you into choosing the least private option. <a href="https://github.blog/2020-12-17-no-cookie-for-you/">Well done to GitHub for removing all non-essential cookies</a> and getting rid of privacy popups.

It's finally done. I migrated my site from <a href="https://robinmassart.wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> to a static site generated by <a href="https://11ty.dev">eleventy</a>. I've also managed to get <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">webmentions</a> working of a sort. Many thanks for all the great help available on the internet.
<p>I list here some sites I found especially helpful, but of course there are many others who gave me a nudge in the right direction.</p></p>
