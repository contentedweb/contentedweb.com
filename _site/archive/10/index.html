These are written as part of it's Testimony Project and includes testimonies from people all over the world. The site launched in early 2007.</p>

Rather it evaluates available information, ranks it and links to it, with higher quality information appearing first in the list of links to various topics about prostate cancer.</p>

In it he basically started the browser wars after it dawned on him that the internet had to power to displace the desktop as the primary gateway to all things digital. All those Office and Windows licences would become uneccessary and Microsoft's cash cow would, metaphorially speaking, be slaughtered. What happened next is now history. In 2001 IE6 was born and browser development took a five year breather.</p>

          <p>In my <a title="Windows computing without a mouse" href="/posts/2011/windows-computing-without-a-mouse/">previous post</a> I provided a list of more advanced keyboard shortcuts to minimise use of the mouse. The next step then, for the really determined, is to minimise use of the keyboard. Windows Vista shipped with reasonable voice recognition software. Windows 7 dramatically improved this software to the point where it is as good as most commercial voice recognition tools. This post will give my impression of using Windows Speech Recognition for the last month or so.</p>

          <p>The introduction of the GUI and the mouse into computing in early 80s revolutionised the computing experience at the time. Yet, the mouse is generally a teribly inefficient way of getting around a computer once you know how to do so without it. This article is intended to get you started in using your (Windows) PC without grabbing for the mouse every other second.</p>

          <p>It's been a little quiet on this blog in the run up to Christmas and the New Year. The new year will see a number of posts on computing for RSI sufferers such as avoiding the mouse and windows voice recognition.</p>
