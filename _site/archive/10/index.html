  <p><img src="/assets/images/ukpl.png" alt="Homepage of the UK Prostate Link website" width="268" height="300" />The UK Prostate Link website was launched in 2005 to assess the quality of information from over 50 websites and to help users find the most reliable information about prostate cancer. It is funded by a number cancer charities and is still going strong now. It is slightly different to most sites about cancer, as it does not contain information about prostate cancer. Rather it evaluates available information, ranks it and links to it, with higher quality information appearing first in the list of links to various topics about prostate cancer.</p>

  <p><img src="/assets/images/mdf.png" alt="MDF eCommunity overview page" width="300" height="280" />MDF The Bipolar Organisation is the national charity dedicated to supporting individuals with the much misunderstood and devastating condition of bipolar, their families and carers.  It also organises self-management training courses designed to teach the individual with bipolar disorder how to recognise the triggers for, and warning signs of, an impending episode of illness. Participants learn to take action to prevent or reduce the severity of an episode. On top of all that it supports a network of local self-help groups across the UK.</p>

  <p>From time to time I get asked by friends: "How do I get into web design?". There's often a sub question to that as to "what package should I use?". This is often the case if the person comes from a graphics design background. If you ask anyone who's anyone in web design what package do they use, the answer will often boil down to:</p>

<p>"Notepad* and a range of browsers"</p>

  <p>Earlier in the year I wrote two posts about using your computer more efficiently using  <a title="Windows computing for RSI sufferers" href="/posts/2011/windows-computing-for-rsi-sufferers/">keyboard shortcuts</a> and <a title="Windows Speech Recognition" href="/posts/2011/windows-speech-recognition/">windows speech recognition</a>. In the three months since then I have gained further insights about how to use the computer without touching the keyboard or mouse.</p>

  <p>In late 1995 Bill Gates sent round the now infamous "<a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/features/auletta/about_book.html">Pearl harbour day memo</a>". In it he basically started the browser wars after it dawned on him that the internet had to power to displace the desktop as the primary gateway to all things digital. All those Office and Windows licences would become uneccessary and Microsoft's cash cow would, metaphorially speaking, be slaughtered. What happened next is now history. In 2001 IE6 was born and browser development took a five year breather.</p>

  <p>In my <a title="Windows computing without a mouse" href="/posts/2011/windows-computing-without-a-mouse/">previous post</a> I provided a list of more advanced keyboard shortcuts to minimise use of the mouse. The next step then, for the really determined, is to minimise use of the keyboard. Windows Vista shipped with reasonable voice recognition software. Windows 7 dramatically improved this software to the point where it is as good as most commercial voice recognition tools. This post will give my impression of using Windows Speech Recognition for the last month or so.</p>

  <p>The introduction of the GUI and the mouse into computing in early 80s revolutionised the computing experience at the time. Yet, the mouse is generally a teribly inefficient way of getting around a computer once you know how to do so without it. This article is intended to get you started in using your (Windows) PC without grabbing for the mouse every other second.</p>

  <p>I recently came across this article about <a href="http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/11/18/evidence-for-informed-trading-on-the-attacks-of-september-11/">Evidence for Informed Trading on the Attacks of September 11</a>. I am not a conspiracy theorist, but I am going to assume that the article is valid. Certainly, the idea that no one other than the perpertrators will have known about the attack is quite far-fetched in my mind. And it doesn't take a huge leap of the imagination to think that someone might try to gain financialy from such an attrocity if they knew it was going to happen. In any case this post is not about that, it's about the ability to use the financial markets to forsee the immediate future.</p>

  <p>According to "SemanticWeb.org", the Semantic Web is a vision: "the idea of having data on the web defined and linked in a way that can be used by machines". In other words, I can take my &lt;ADDRESS&gt; tag from the article above and in the Semantic Web, assuming it has been created according to the (as yet undefined) Semantic Web spec and send it to any Semantic Web machine. This machine will then know that the tag it refers to is the location of someone's home or office.</p>
