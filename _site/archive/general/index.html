  <p>I have to watch the carbohydrates I eat, since I am Type 2 pre-diabetic, I made myself this list of foods I tend to eat by carbs per 100g. I've split them into 3 categories, based on the carbs per100g:</p>
<ul>
<li>high carbs, anything above 35g</li>
<li>medium carbs, between 15g and 35g</li>
<li>low carbs, between 1g and 15g</li>
<li>Negligible or no carbs, below 1g</li>
</ul>
<p>My source is basically Google searches.  This is a work in progress and will change as I add to this list.</p>

<h3><a href="/posts/2021/vaccine-equality/">Vaccine equality</a></h3>

  <p>As the richer western countries approach their ceiling of who they can vaccinate freely, they are starting to vaccinate those under 18 in a drive to increase the overall vaccination rate.  This is understandable, but I wonder if a better use for those vaccines would be to ship them to poorer countries to help them in their vaccination efforts.</p>
<p>The effect of Covid on the young is very small. It is true we do not know the long term implications of having had covid. Long-covid is a real thing, which also affects the young. But the long term effects of the vaccine are also unknown.  It is looking increasingly likely that we will need yearly booster shots. Do we really want to be vaccinating 12 year olds and jabbing them every year for the rest of their lives? This is new territory, it has never been done before.</p>
<p>Let's get the world's adult population vaccinated first. As we get to understand the virus better maybe we will find a single shot solution.</p>

  <p>Yesterday I had my second Pfizer jab against Covid. When I had my first jab I felt nothing, no side effects. A slight itch on the shoulder maybe. Nothing worse than a mosquito bite.  The second one is a different matter. I woke up this morning sore, stiff and tired. No fever or other flu like symptoms, but definitely worse than the first jab. Hopefully by the weekend I will be better.</p>

<p><a href="https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/149552596">This comment on an article about climate change</a> really resonated with me:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/149552596">It's wrong to frame radical pro climate changes as sacrifices which we have to bear with gritted teeth. Its good for your health to eat less meat, cycle or walk instead of hopping in the car. Its good for peoples health too because of reduced pollution.. Its satisfying to mend thongs instead of throwing them away. Its a pleasure to use beautiful things for a long time crafted by people who enjoyed making them, instead of throwing things away in an endless cycle of obsolescence of the ugly.</blockquote>
<p>Most actions related to stopping cimate change would also be good for our general health, mental as well as physical.</p>

<h3><a href="/posts/2021/covid-vaccinations-europe/">Covid vaccination rollout in Europe</a></h3>
<time datetime="2021-04-13 02:00:00"><span class="date-day">13</span> <span class="date-month">April</span>, <span class="date-year">2021</span></time>
  <p>
With last month's arguments between the EU and UK, regarding vaccine contracts and deliveries I did some back of an envelope analysis. It seems the real issue is not so much contracts, but the general lack of vacciness, partially due to the inability of one specific manufacturer to deliver their promised amounts of vaccines. Here are the stats as of the 10th April 2021:
<table>
  <caption>Vaccination progress for the EU and UK</caption>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <th>EU</th>
    <th>UK</th>
    <th>Combined</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Doses given (millions)</th>
    <td>93</td>
    <td>39</td>
    <td>132</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Population (millions)</th>
    <td>445</td>
    <td>68</td>
    <td>513</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Ratio doses to population</th>
    <td>0.21</td>
    <td>0.57</td>
    <td>0.26</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>All data from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">Our World in Data</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
As can be seen from the table if all the vaccine doses administered by the 10th April had been spread evenly across the EU and the UK, the effect on the vaccination rate of the EU would have been minimal: an increase of 5 doses per 100 inhabitants.  But in the UK the effect would have been drastic: a decrease of 31 doses per 100 in habitants. So whilst complaints about vaccine export controls and contracts mimicking such export controls might be valid, the real issue is the limited capacity to produce the vaccines. This is where the focus needs to be - not on blaming each other for hoarding vaccines.

  <p>After acquiring Flickr, SmugMug have announced a limit of 1000 photos for the free accounts and a doubling of the PRO membership fees. Unfortunately not in that order.  So shortly after cancelling my PRO membership as I was unwilling to shell out double for no useful improvements, I am told I will lose 12000+ of my 13000+ images stored on Flickr. It seems to me SmugMug are blackmailing me to come back... Just as well I've already downloaded and moved all my photos to OneDrive about a year ago. Now all I need to do is recreate the albums and I can say, very sadly, goodbye to Flickr.  Looks like I will also be able to finally start closing <a href="/posts/2018/flickr-smugmug-and-yahoo/">my yahoo account</a>.</p>

<p>So, SmuMug bought Flickr from Verizon a few months back (news always reaches me a little later...).  Will that be the end of my Yahoo account? I only have a Yahoo account for two reasons (in that order):</p>
