  <p>This post is written using the wordpress android app. <a href="http://android.wordpress.org/">You can download it here</a>.</p>
<p>It has been written using android speech to text function. This works very well as long as you have a wifi connection. So it helps I am waiting for my daughter at the OMV petrol station which has free wifi!</p>

  <p>Everyone knows that exercise is good for you. Not just on a physical level, but it also makes you "happier" due to the release of Endorphins, the body’s natural feel good chemicals.&nbsp; Well, since I completed the <a title="Completed Couch To 5K" href="/posts/2011/completed-couch-to-5k/">C25K</a> program I've started noticing there's much more to it than simply being happier. Jogging seems to have some sort of meditative effect, a fact I alluded to in my post on the <a title="Anatomy of one of my&nbsp;jogs" href="/posts/2011/anatomy-of-one-of-my-jogs/">anatomy of one of my jogs</a>. I noted that once I really get going I am able to spend a few seconds at a time in a trance like state with a completely clear mind. On top of that, towards the end of the jog all the aches and pains actually dissapear. Well here's my theory as to why that is.</p>

<h3><a href="/posts/2011/bridge-to-10k/">Bridge to 10k</a></h3>
<time datetime="2011-10-23 12:00:00"><span class="date-day">23</span> <span class="date-month">October</span>, <span class="date-year">2011</span></time>
  <p>Now that <a title="Completed Couch To 5K" href="/posts/2011/completed-couch-to-5k/">I've completed the C25K running program</a>, I am looking to run further as well as increase my pace a little. "Bridge to 10 k" (B210k for short) appears to be the acronym to use, but the various <a title="Bridge to 10k program example" href="http://blog.c25kapp.com/about-bridge-to-10k/">implementations I've come across</a> are too complicated for my little mind. <a title="Completed Couch To 5K" href="/posts/2011/completed-couch-to-5k/">I don't currently have an iPod</a> or smartphone so I really don't want to be starting and stopping anymore. I just want to run for X minutes or kilometers and be done with it. This may not be the ideal methodology to follow, but it will do for me.</p>

  <p>Since I've started jogging and manage longer distances and time I've noticed a common pattern that I thought I would write down here and see it changes with time. It roughly goes like this:</p>

  <p>9 weeks ago I started on the Couch To 5K (C25K) running program. Today I completed it.</p>

  <p>Does this sound familiar?</p>

Of course, it's hard to get the bristles these days even if you can find people to do the proper binding, and the spells need...'<br />'I don't want it rebuilt, I just want it to work properly,' said Granny.<br />'It's an early model, you see', the dwarf plugged on. 'Very tricky, those early models. You can't get the wood...'<br />He was picked up bodily until his eyes were level with Granny's. Dwarves, being magical in themselves, as it were, are quite resistant to magic but her expression looked as though she was trying to weld his eyeballs to the back of his skull.<br />'Just repair it,' she hissed. 'Please?'<br />'What, make a bodge job?' said the dwarf, his pipe clattering to the floor.<br />'Yes.'<br />'Patch it up, you mean? Betray my training by doing a half job?'<br />'Yes,' said Granny. Her pupils were two little black holes.<br />'Oh,' said the dwarf. 'Right, then.'</p>

<p>You're certainly not the first to do (or request!) a botch job and nor will you be the last...</p>
