                <p>In October 1997 I embarked on a 7 months &quot;Round-The-World&quot; trip.   A lot of my initial preparation (and motivation) was done using the Internet, so I have decided to give back to the online community a little bit of what I experienced whilst away.  And hopefully entice others to do the same.</p>

<td><a title="Reasons for Backpacking" href="/posts/2000/reasons-for-backpacking/">Reasons</a></td>
<td>Why bother?  Why leave behind the comfort of your own home and take off.  Why swap a 2 piece ward drobe for a titchy bag?  Here's why.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a title="Preparation" href="/posts/2000/preparation/">Preparation</a></td>
<td>What vaccinations are needed?  Is it safe and how much does it cost?  In my experience preparation is a mental thing.  Leave with an open frame of mind, think positive and your trip will be all the more enjoyable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a title="Packing" href="/posts/2000/packing/">Packing</a></td>
<td>What to take and what not to.  Do I take a gameboy for those long bus rides or do I try to catch up on those literature lessons I missed at school?  Try not to overpack, but after seeing skateboards strapped to the back of backpacks I've finally understood Einstein. Everything is relative!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a title="My Trip" href="/posts/2000/my-trip/">My Trip</a></td>
<td>Take the guided tour.  The best of my photos combined with my thoughts on returning and some info on the countries I visited make this a must see tour.  Well I would say that wouldn't I!!!</td>
