                <p>After almost a year away due to the ongoing pandemic, we finally returned to Plovdiv for a week in May. The city was as lovely as usual, especially in the central old town area. Here are some photos of the city from the trip.</p>
<h2>Kapana</h2>
<p>The word Kapana means &quot;trap&quot; in Bulgarian. This is a beautifully restored quarter of small winding streets in which it is easy to get lost - or trapped.  Only a few years ago this area was dirty and run down. It has now been restored and largely pedestrianised, full of little shops, cafes, restaurants and pubs.</p>

<h2>Dzhumaya Mosque</h2>
<p>This 14th century mosque is one of the largest on the Balkans. It's justaxposition looking over the ruins of the ancient roman Philipopolis stadium is exceptional.  There is also a great Turkish cafe on its northern side.</p>

<h2>The old town</h2>
<p>The old town of the city, built on the Nebet Tepe hill is a lovely place to stroll around and to escape the noise of the city below.</p>

<p>On top of the hill is also situated is the old roman amphitheatre with fantastic views over the city and onto the Rhodope mountains in the distance.</p>

<p>The amphitheatre is still in use and regularly hosts all sorts of music concerts in the summer months.</p>

<p>There is plenty more to see in Plovdiv. Best visited in Spring or early Summer to avoid the heat. Alternatively, visit in September when the city usual puts on a number of festivals after the hot July and August months. :-)</p>
