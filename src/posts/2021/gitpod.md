Over the last few months I've made my hosting environment entirely serverless thanks to the help of [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Forrestry ](https://forestry.io/)and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Next, I wanted a cloud based development environment, so if I wasn't at my laptop and wanted to make a change, I could.

There were quite a few options, but the two that seemed to fit the bill for me were [GitPod ](https://www.gitpod.io/)and [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). The latter is not yet available to the general public. Whilst I did register for access, it's not yet been granted. That left me with GitPod. So I signed up, pointed it at my preview branch on GitHub
