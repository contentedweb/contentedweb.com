### Sprint Qualifying

Yesterday I watched the enthralling race at Silverstone.  It was the first Formula 1 race ever to use a sprint race to decide the pole position. This was a fairly lack lustre affair and certainly did not bring the hoped for extra excitement. They have a couple more races like this, after which I hope they ditch them.

### The race opening

The highlight of the race was the spectacular collision between Verstappen and Hamilton on the second lap at Copse.  Having raced nose to nose for the opening lap, Hamilton saw a gap and dummied left before going down the right of Verstappen leading into Copse. They were more or less side-by-side, with Verstappen slightly in the lead, but Hamilton having the inside line. Just before the apex Verstappen pulled across Hamilton's line thinking Hamilton would move further to the right or lift off slightly. He didn't and Verstappen's right rear wheel clipped Hamilton's left front, sending Verstappen into sideways into the barriers with 51G impact! He walked away, but was a littler dazed and got checked up in hospital.

[The stewards decided this was Hamilton's fault](https://f1i.com/news/412726-fia-justifies-decision-to-penalize-hamilton-for-verstappen-crash.html) and gave him a 10 second penalty, which he had observe during his first pit stop. Their decision read as follows:

> "The Stewards reviewed video and telemetry evidence," read their ruling. "Cars 33 \[Verstappen\] and 44 \[Hamilton\] entered turn 9 with Car 33 in the lead and Car 44 slightly behind and on the inside.
>
> "Car 44 was on a line that did not reach the apex of the corner, with room available to the inside.
>
> "When Car 33 turned into the corner, Car 44 did not avoid contact and the left front of Car 44 contacted the right rear of Car 33. Car 44 is judged predominantly at fault."
