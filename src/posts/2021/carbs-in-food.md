I have to watch the carbohydrates I eat, since I am Type 2 pre-diabetic, I made myself this list of foods I tend to eat by carbs per 100g. I've split them into 3 categories:

* high carbs, anything above 30g carbs per 100g
* medium carbs, between 10g and 30g
* low carbs, under 10g per 100g

My source is basically Google searches.

### High carbs

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Food</th>
    <th>Carbs per 100g</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sugar</td>
    <td>100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Brown bread</td>
    <td>56</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>White bread</td>
    <td>49</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Medium

### Low carbs
