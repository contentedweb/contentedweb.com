I can't help feeling that too much design is focused on visual aesthetics and not on making things usable. Aesthetics has its place and not everything has to be intuitively usable. Cleanly designed web interface do look good. However, removing interaction clues in order to make something look neat and clean is not always in the interests of the user. 

Microsoft's web bases Outlook is a good example. Don't get me wrong, I think Outlook is great. I use it every day, both at work and for my personal emails. The web version is very functional and generally well thought out in my opinion. Yet, the way the scroll bars are implemented is frustrating. Here's a screenshot of Outlook's user interface to illustrate my point:
