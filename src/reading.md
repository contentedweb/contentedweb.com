This is a list of books I have read in reverse chronological order. 

## Blindsight - Peter Watts
August 2021

A well written hard science fiction book. The hard science can be difficult follow at times, but the concepts and storyline are original.

## This is How You Lose the Time War - Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone.
January 2021

An interesting approach to cooperating on a book with each author "playing" one of the two spies chasing each other through time and space.
